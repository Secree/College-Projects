	Alex had always been a curious boy. One rainy afternoon, while exploring his grandmotherâ€™s attic, he stumbled upon an old,rusty key inside a wooden box. 
        He felt a strange excitement. "What could it open?" he wondered.
 	He searched the attic and found an ancient chest covered in dust. With a deep breath, he inserted the key and turned it. 
        The lock clicked, and the chest creaked open, revealing a collection of letters andjewels. 
        Among them was a note from his great-grandfather: "Curiosity leads to great discoveries. Keep searching, and you'll always find somethingvaluable."
	Smiling, Alex realized that adventure was always just a question away.
