Warning: the program will encounter an error if you don't have java oracle version 22.

Hello user, our program is designed for people who work and study for long periods of time.

How it works:

1. It has 4 challenges, each with a frame that will pop up at various times (10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, and finally 30 minutes).

2. After 30 minutes, it will loop. If you want to stop the loop, just click the "I give up" button.

Note:

If you don't like waiting that long for it to pop up, just open the system tray and click it there to 
trigger the next challenge immediately.
